> To only a fraction of the human race does God give the privilege of earning one's bread doing what one would have gladly pursued free, for passion. I am very thankful. - Frederick Brooks, [The Mythical Man-Month](https://smile.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959)


![Brandon Pugh profile image](/images/about_me.jpg)

My name is Brandon Pugh and I'm a software developer working for a software consultancy in Austin. I'm passionate about what I do and I especially enjoy building web based applications. Currently my experience is mostly in the Microsoft web stack though I work on all aspects of an application from the UX in javascript to SQL Server stored procedures in T-Sql. I also enjoy reading, movies, dancing, and finding ways to utilize technology to make life easier. I'm searching for new ways to hone my [craft](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/).
