[eslint-config-prettier Compromised: How npm Package with 30 Million Downloads Spread Malware â€” Safe and Trusted Open Source](https://safedep.io/eslint-config-prettier-major-npm-supply-chain-hack/)

This is pretty scary after reading about what it would probably do. I've worked on projects with this dependency before and it could have been very easy to fall victim to it.
Fortunately this was caught fairly quickly (I think the packages were only up for about a day) but it was only because someone happened to notice it.

Seems almost necessary now to use a tool like npq.
