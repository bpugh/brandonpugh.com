[Pushing a whole stack of branches with a single Git command](https://andrewlock.net/pushing-a-whole-stack-of-branches-with-a-single-git-command/)

This has been my biggest pain point also with stacked branches and Andrew did the work of creating some git aliases to make this much easier. Thank you!
