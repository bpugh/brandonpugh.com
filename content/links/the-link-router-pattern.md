[The link router pattern | James' Coffee Blog](https://jamesg.blog/2025/07/19/link-router-pattern)

James shares some cool examples of what he calls "link router" sites, including his own [Subscribe Openly](https://subscribeopenly.net/).

I agree with James that it is frustrating that the onus is on the person sharing the link.
I like to use [pods.link](https://pods.link) and [songs.link](https://song.link/) because that's the experience I would prefer to have but I don't think I've ever gotten one of those links from someone.

It does feel like it wouldn't be _too_ much work to build a type service like what he describes... will definitely have to have a think on it...
