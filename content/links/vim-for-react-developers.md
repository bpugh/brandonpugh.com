[Vim for React Developers](https://vimforreactdevs.com/)

For anyone who is vim-curious, I think this is a cool approach to learning practical uses for vim.
The "course" is just a react source file ([direct link](https://github.com/leerob/vim-for-react-devs/blob/main/public/course.tsx)) with the instructions as comments describing how to modify the various bits of code throughout the file.
Even though the file is a react component, examples are largely just as applicable to most programming languages (especially those with c-like syntax) as well as editing regular HTML.

I would suggest though, if you've never used vim before that an easier setup to dip your toes in would be to install to the [vim extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) for vscode (or for [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JaredParMSFT.VsVim2022Preview)).
