Yjs is a CRDT (Conflict-free replicated data type) library for building collaborative and local-first apps. I've come across CDRTs in the past as being pretty powerful pattern but aren't the most intuitive so this could be a handy tutorial. I haven't had a chance to play with it but this looks like a great way to learn about building collaborative, syncing webapps from the ground up.
