Another day, another supply chain compromise.
What's interesting about this incident, aside from how popular Nx is, is the use of AI.
First the code that allowed NX to be compromised was generated by Claude Code and reviewed by an AI bot.
You can see [the PR that introduced the vulnerability](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/32458/files#diff-0f55b87380c49811ff502d3f6b33e35e26dd5c22a69880c4415f6438a9f73672R26-R38) was meant
to enforce PR titles follow convention, but it just takes the arbitrary text from the PR on the _public internet_ and throws it into bash without any sanitization.
So there's a good chance it wasn't actually reviewed by a person.
Secondly the malware that was later run on devs machines, tries to enlist tools like Claude Code to help it find secrets.
