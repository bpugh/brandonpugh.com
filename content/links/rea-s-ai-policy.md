[REA's AI Policy - Room Escape Artist](https://roomescapeartist.com/2025/06/28/reas-ai-policy/)

I'm a fan of escape rooms and I recently discovered this great website dedicated to them.
Aside from their regular posts however, I appreciated this recent post detailing in what ways if at all they use AI.
It seems like a reasonable approach for an online publication but also speaks to the sad state of the AI slob-riddled internet these days that they have to make a post like this.
