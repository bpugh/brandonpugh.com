[Boxie - an always offline audio player for my 3 year old](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-04-20-boxie/)

This is pretty impressive post from a Dad who built his own version of a Toniebox.
My son also has a Toniebox, and it is a cool little device but some things about it I find very annoying and I've frequently had the thought "I should be able to make a better one...".

Right now though I'm just trying to learn a bit of electronics just to be able to fix his toys when they stop working which feels like all the time.
