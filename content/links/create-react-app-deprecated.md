I'm glad they finally "officially" deprecated it since it hasn't been the greatest choice for a while now...

Like the docs now recommend, [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) is a much better choice.

You can run `npm create vite@latest` to get a starting point very similar to CRA but much faster and with less bloat.

The only thing I wish it included was tests setup but this post does a good job showing how to do that: [Simple React and Vite setup with unit testing](https://reactpractice.dev/articles/simple-react-and-vite-setup-with-unit-testing/)
