[A Sneaky Phish Just Grabbed my Mailchimp Mailing List](https://www.troyhunt.com/a-sneaky-phish-just-grabbed-my-mailchimp-mailing-list/)

Wow even Troy Hunt (a well-known security researcher and creator of [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)) fell for a phishing email.
To be fair I think it could have happened to any of us.
The email looks fairly well crafted and I appreciated his analysis of the factors that led to him falling victim.

Honestly the most frustrating part is the fact that Mailchimp doesn't delete unsubscribed emails and even worse they give you no way to opt out of that so a list owner would have to regularly go in an delete them manually... and why do they store your IP address?? ðŸ˜¡

I also thought it was sneaky that they generated an api key on his account. So in addition to updating login credentials remember to check for any recently added api keys.

I hadn't thought of this vector before, but it's now one more reason why I prefer subscribing via RSS.
