[An Undefeated Pull Request Template | Ashlee M Boyer](https://ashleemboyer.com/blog/pull-request-template/)

This is probably the best and most thorough advice I've seen on how to write good pull request descriptions.

So many great bits of advice and things I wanted to +1.

> The first goal of a pull request description is to make code review as straightforward and frictionless as possible.

> Even if everyone knows the code, youâ€™re saving them time by doing the thinking for them. The code is still fresh in your mind whereas they might need to take a few minutes to recall how the feature works.

> The goal is to preemptively answer common high-level questions that come up in code review.
