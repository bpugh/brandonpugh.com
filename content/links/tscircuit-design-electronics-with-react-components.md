[tscircuit - Design Electronics with React Components](https://tscircuit.com/)

This does look like an interesting approach to designing circuit boards.
I've only recently begun getting into *very* beginner electronics so maybe I'll come back to this some day and see if this makes the process easier given my background in React (should I ever find myself needing to design my own cirbuit board).
