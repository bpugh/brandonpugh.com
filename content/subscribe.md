These are the various ways to find out when I post things to my site.

## RSS Feeds

- [Articles feed](https://www.brandonpugh.com/post/index.xml) - just my longer form blog entries
- [TIL feed](https://www.brandonpugh.com/til/index.xml) - "Today I learned" posts
- [Links feed](https://www.brandonpugh.com/links/index.xml) - A good old fashioned [link blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/)â€”[Links](/links/) I've found worth sharing.

## Email

If you prefer to get updates in your inbox, then enter your email here:

<form
  action="
          https://buttondown.com/api/emails/embed-subscribe/bpugh
         "
  method="post"
>
  <label class="visuallyhidden" for="bd-email">Enter your email</label>
  <input type="email" autocomplete="email" name="email" placeholder="you@example.com" id="bd-email" required />
  <input type="hidden" value="1" name="embed" />
  <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
</form>

This isn't a hip newsletter, it's literally just my posts in their entirety, whenever I publish them.
