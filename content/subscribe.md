## Email

If you prefer to get updates in your inbox, then enter your email here:

<form
  action="
          https://buttondown.com/api/emails/embed-subscribe/bpugh
         "
  method="post"
>
  <label class="visuallyhidden" for="bd-email">Enter your email</label>
  <input type="email" autocomplete="email" name="email" placeholder="you@example.com" id="bd-email" />
  <input type="hidden" value="1" name="embed" />
  <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
</form>

This isn't a hip newsletter, it's literally just my posts in their entirety, whenever I publish them.
