title: Blazor Best Practices Borrowed From React
---

Blazor took a lot of design decisions from React and other frontend frameworks and as a stateful component-based UI framework there is quite a bit of experience that can be transferred from one to the other.

I gave this talk earlier this year at KCDC and then last week I presented an updated version as a Jetbrains webinar. Special thanks to [Khalid](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/) for inviting me on and being an excellent host!

I hope to write up the content in a more in depth post sometime soon, but in the mean time you can watch the recording on [Youtube][1] and view the slides at [brandonpugh.com/blazor-talk](https://www.brandonpugh.com/blazor-talk/#/).

Some of the points I cover:

* State management
* Reusable components
* Accessibility
* Testing
