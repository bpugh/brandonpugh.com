I finally migrated my blog from Wordpress to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and given all the blog posts I came across while getting it setup it seems almost like a rite of passage to blog about it once you've migrated.

## Why make the move?!

For the hacker street cred of course. But seriously, I was growing really tired with the performance of Wordpress and dealing with shared hosting on Godaddy and my colleague suggested I give Octopress a try and so here I am.

I did run into some snags getting it building on Windows but now it's running smoothly. I must say I really like the idea of having all of my content version controlled and in a portable plain text format. Plus this will be a good way to get some additional experience with ruby.
