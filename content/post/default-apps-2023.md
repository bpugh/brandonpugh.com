title: My default apps of 2023
---

I saw this on [Chris Coyier's blog](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/11/25/default-apps-2023/) and thought I would jump on the bandwagon.
[The idea](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097), is to see for how many things you use the default apps for your system, which for me is mostly on Android/Google.

It's a fun exercise and I totally get the arguments for "just" using default apps, but I also get a little sad at the thought of huge companies like Apple and Google able beat better alternatives simply because they're the default.
