2025-06-16 Update: This is now [built-in to Visual Studio](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/introducing-the-copy-git-permalink-feature-in-visual-studio-17-12/).

Today I learned about the [Copy Git Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EtienneBAUDOUX.CopyGitLink2022&ssr=false#overview) extension for Visual Studio which will give you the url of currently selected lines on your git hosting provider i.e azure devops or GitHub. 

Especially handy for quickly pointing a teammate to a particular part of the codebase.
