This also led me to discover that Visual Studio comes with a builtin [keyboard mapping scheme for VSCode](https://stackoverflow.com/a/62414810/1715138) hotkeys which has more modern defaults.
For instance, it changes `ctrl+p` to open the fuzzy file finder instead of the print dialog... I don't know that I've ever wanted to print a source code file...  
except one time long ago when I wanted to convince a higher-up the need to refactor a sql query so I taped together the 10+ page printout ðŸ˜….
