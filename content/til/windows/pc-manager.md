I used to have tools like CCleaner and Revo uninstaller installed on my windows machines but I recently learned that Microsoft now has their utility called [PC Manager](https://pcmanager.microsoft.com/en-us) that does things like free up some disk space and disable startup apps.

Though [as this article](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/stop-using-ccleaner-windows/) points out, you can accomplish a lot of similar tasks without a dedicated tool, so it's more for if you find it convenient.
