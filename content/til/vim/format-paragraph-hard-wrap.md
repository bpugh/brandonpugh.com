title: Format a paragraph

In vim you can [format a paragraph](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Automatic_formatting_of_paragraphs) of prose text with `gq`.
This basically will hard-wrap the lines to the configured `textwidth` for the filetype.

I use this all the time when writing git commit messages so the body of the message has the [recommended](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) max line length of 72.
