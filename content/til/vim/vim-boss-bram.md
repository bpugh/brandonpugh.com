I just found out [about the passing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37011324) of Bram Moolenaar, the core maintainer of Vim for the last 30 years ðŸ˜ž

I like what a commenter posted:
> Vim has soul. It is that chisel you inherited from your grandpa that you keep using. It fits well in your grip and is comfortable, even though it lacks the soft rubber that the new ones in the store have. It's a tool with its own history.

Vim was the first real editor I used. I learned it on the CS department shared Unix server by following the instructions on a paper handout our TA gave us... and ever since I haven't been able to type in anything without `hjkl`.
