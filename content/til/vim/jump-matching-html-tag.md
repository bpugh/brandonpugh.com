title: Pressing `%` will also jump to the matching HTML tag
tags: ['vim']

I've used `%` for some time now in vim, but I only just today learned that it not only jumps to a matching bracket or parenthesis, but also a matching **HTML tag**!

Unfortunately this doesn't seem to work with vscode-vim but it does work with vscode-neovim.

You could also accomplish this by assigning a hotkey to the "Go to matching pair" Emmet command.
