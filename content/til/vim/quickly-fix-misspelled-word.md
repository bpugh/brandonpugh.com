I just learned that you can have automatically fix a misspelled word with the top suggestion by typing:

```vim
1z=
```

This is opposed to the regular `z=` command for opening the regular list of spelling correction options.

Like [Josh](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/blob/master/vim/quickly-fix-a-misspelled-word.md) who I learned this from, I usually pick the first option so this is a bit more convenient.
