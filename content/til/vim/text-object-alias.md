title: b is an Alias for Parenthesis in Vim

I just discovered that `b` and `B` are aliases for the `()` and `{}` text objects respectively.

This is a nice little builtin improvement since I frequently find myself selecting or changing withing parenthesis and `cib` is nicer to type than `ci(`.

I only wished I'd discovered this years ago!
