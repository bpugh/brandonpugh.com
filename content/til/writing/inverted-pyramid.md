Continue with the writing, Today I learned about the [inverted pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)) in journalism:

It's a way to structure content so that it "begins with the details that readers care about most. As the article progresses, the focus shifts toward details that are relevant only to the most interested readers."

I came across it in this great post about [How to Write Useful Commit Messages](https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/commit-messages/) but is just as applicable to blog posts/reports/docs/emails.

As a reader this is nice because you can get the info you care about faster and bail at any point.  
As an author you reduce the risk that you'll lose people before you've made your main point.
