title: Quickly react to recent message in Slack
tags: ['writing', 'communication']

Today I learned that you can react to the most recent message just by adding `+`.
So you can type `+:thumbsup:` as the message it add it as a reaction to the most recent message instead of an individual message.

You can also type `⌘⇧\` or `ctrl⇧\` to open the emoji picker on the message.
