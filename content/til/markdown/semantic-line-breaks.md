title: Semantic line breaks (one sentence per line)
tags: ['markdown', 'writing']
---

I just discovered [Semantic Line Breaks](https://sembr.org/).
I could never decide on exactly how to do line breaks in markdown so I love that someone came up with a convention that's been thought through.

This led me to discover this post by Derek Sivers: [Writing one sentence per line](https://sive.rs/1s)

What's interesting is that while he's recommending the same approach, he suggests that it will improve your writing itself.

Nicer git diffs is just a side benefit. ðŸ™‚

Definitely going to adopt this now and see how I like it.
