title: Github supports alerts in markdown

Today I learned that Github [supports alerts][doc] in markdown using the blockquote syntax:

```md
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.
```

This is an extension to the standard markdown syntax that's I've supported more and more in various markdown tools like Obsidian and vscode (they're also referred to as callouts or admonitions).
